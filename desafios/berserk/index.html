          That thing was too big to be called a sword. <br />
          Too big, too thick, too <br />
          heavy, and too rough, <br />
          it was more like a large hunk of iron. <br />

          Things you have now, things you've lost. <br />
          People who're near by, people <br />
          who've gone far away. <br />
          No matter what you choose, truth is, both regret <br />
          and reluctance are going to follow you around. <br />
          You just have to make sure you don't make <br />
          excuses to yourself down the road. <br />

          You went alone. <br />
          You were right beside those <br />
          irreplacable things...yet <br />
          you couldn't bear to immerse <br />
          yourself together in sorrow with them. So <br />
          instead...you ran away so that <br />
          your own malice could burn within you. <br />

          Ambition comes with a price attached. <br />
          Of course, that price comes too <br />
          high if you die for nothing. <br />
          The reward for ambition too great... is <br />
          self-destruction! <br />

          You’re going to be all right. <br />
          You just stumbled over a stone in the <br />
          road. It means nothing. <br />
          Your goal lies far beyond this. <br />
          Doesn’t it? <br />
          I’m sure you’ll overcome this. <br />
          You’ll walk again… soon. <br />

          Do not play! If you pray, your hands will close together. <br />
          You will not be able to fight! <br />
          <br>

        <p>Hate is a place, someone who can't take sadness goes. <br /></p>
        <p>
          <br>
          If you're always worried about crushing the ants under your feet, you
          will never walk.<br/>
        </p>
        <br>
        You're right, we are mortal and fragile. <br />
        But even if we are tortured or wounded, <br />
        we'll fight to survive. <br />
        <br>
        <p>
          You should feel the pain we feel and understand. <br />
          I am the messenger that will deliver <br />
          you to that pain and understanding.

          Dragons are dragons because humans can't beat them. <br />
          So what's a man who kills dragons? <br />
